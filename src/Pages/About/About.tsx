        <Subtitle>
        Virbound is a community of creative and interesting people. 
        We like to play games together, watch various YouTube videos, stream our suffering in souls-like games, 
        do hard tearing with Linux kernel recompilation, and much more. 
        In short, we have the funniest and coolest group of friends.
        </Subtitle><br/>
        <Subtitle>
        By the way: Virbound is a combination of the words Virtual and Bound, 
        which can be translated as ‚Äúvirtually connected‚Äù.
